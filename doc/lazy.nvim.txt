FEATURES                                                  *lazy.nvim-features*


- Manage all your Neovim plugins with a powerful UI
- Fast startup times thanks to automatic caching and bytecode compilation of lua modules
- Partial clones instead of shallow clones
- Automatic lazy-loading of lua modules and lazy-loading on events, commands, filetypes, and key mappings
- Automatically install missing plugins before starting up Neovim, allowing you to start using it right away
- Async execution for improved performance
- No need to manually compile plugins
- Correct sequencing of dependencies
- Configurable in multiple files
- Generates helptags of the headings in `README.md` files for plugins that don’t have vimdocs
- Dev options and patterns for using local plugins
- Profiling tools to optimize performance
- Lockfile `lazy-lock.json` to keep track of installed plugins
- Automatically check for updates
- Commit, branch, tag, version, and full Semver <https://devhints.io/semver> support
- Statusline component to see the number of pending updates


REQUIREMENTS                                          *lazy.nvim-requirements*


- Neovim >= **0.8.0** (needs to be built with **LuaJIT**)
- Git >= **2.19.0** (for partial clones support)
- a Nerd Font <https://www.nerdfonts.com/> **_(optional)_**


INSTALLATION                                          *lazy.nvim-installation*

You can add the following Lua code to your `init.lua` to bootstrap
**lazy.nvim**

>lua
    local lazypath = vim.fn.stdpath("data") .. "/lazy/lazy.nvim"
    if not vim.loop.fs_stat(lazypath) then
      vim.fn.system({
        "git",
        "clone",
        "--filter=blob:none",
        "--single-branch",
        "https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim.git",
        lazypath,
      })
    end
    vim.opt.runtimepath:prepend(lazypath)
<


Next step is to add **lazy.nvim** to the top of your `init.lua`

>lua
    require("lazy").setup(plugins, opts)
<



- **plugins**: this should be a `table` or a `string`
    - `table`: a list with your |lazy.nvim-plugin-spec|
    - `string`: a Lua module name that contains your |lazy.nvim-plugin-spec|. See |lazy.nvim-structuring-your-plugins|
- **opts**: see |lazy.nvim-configuration| **_(optional)_**


>lua
    -- example using a list of specs with the default options
    vim.g.mapleader = " " -- make sure to set `mapleader` before lazy so your mappings are correct
    
    require("lazy").setup({
      "folke/which-key.nvim",
      { "folke/neoconf.nvim", cmd = "Neoconf" },
      "folke/neodev.nvim",
    })
<


It is recommended to run `:checkhealth lazy` after installation

LAZY LOADING ~

**lazy.nvim** automagically lazy-loads Lua modules, so it is not needed to
specify `module=...` everywhere in your plugin specification. This mean that if
you have a plugin `A` that is lazy-loaded and a plugin `B` that requires a
module of plugin `A`, then plugin `A` will be loaded on demand as expected.

If you don’t want this behavior for a certain plugin, you can specify that
with `module=false`. You can then manually load the plugin with `:Lazy load
foobar.nvim`.

You can configure **lazy.nvim** to lazy-load all plugins by default with
`config.defaults.lazy = true`.

Additionally, you can also lazy-load on **events**, **commands**, **file
types** and **key mappings**.

Plugins will be lazy-loaded when one of the following is `true`:


- the plugin only exists as a dependency in your spec
- it has an `event`, `cmd`, `ft` or `keys` key
- it defines an `init` method
- `config.defaults.lazy == true`


VERSIONING ~

If you want to install a specific revision of a plugin, you can use `commit`,
`tag`, `branch`, `version`.

The `version` property supports Semver <https://semver.org/> ranges.

Click to see some examples


- :latest stable version (this excludes pre-release versions)
- `1.2.x`: any version that starts with `1.2`, such as `1.2.0`, `1.2.3`, etc.
- `^1.2.3`: any version that is compatible with `1.2.3`, such as `1.3.0`, `1.4.5`, etc., but not `2.0.0`.
- `~1.2.3`: any version that is compatible with `1.2.3`, such as `1.2.4`, `1.2.5`, but not `1.3.0`.
- `>1.2.3`: any version that is greater than `1.2.3`, such as `1.3.0`, `1.4.5`, etc.
- `>=1.2.3`: any version that is greater than or equal to `1.2.3`, such as `1.2.3`, `1.3.0`, `1.4.5`, etc.
- `<1.2.3`: any version that is less than `1.2.3`, such as `1.1.0`, `1.0.5`, etc.
- `<=1.2.3`: any version that is less than or equal to `1.2.3`, such as `1.2.3`, `1.1.0`, `1.0.5`, etc


You can set `config.defaults.version = ""` to install the latest stable version
of plugins that support Semver.

CONFIGURATION                                        *lazy.nvim-configuration*

**lazy.nvim** comes with the following defaults:

>lua
    {
      root = vim.fn.stdpath("data") .. "/lazy", -- directory where plugins will be installed
      defaults = {
        lazy = false, -- should plugins be lazy-loaded?
        version = nil,
        -- version = "", -- enable this to try installing the latest stable versions of plugins

USAGE                                                        *lazy.nvim-usage*

Plugins are managed with the `:Lazy` command. Open the help with `<?>` to see
all the key mappings.

You can press `<CR>` on a plugin to show its details. Most properties can be
hovered with `<K>` to open links, help files, readmes, git commits and git
issues.

Lazy can automatically check for updates in the background. This feature can be
enabled with `config.checker.enabled = true`.

Any operation can be started from the UI, with a sub command or an API
function:

If you want to display the number of plugins on your dashboard, you can use
this simple API:

>lua
    local plugins = require("lazy").stats().count
<


**lazy.nvim** provides a statusline component that you can use to show the
number of pending updates. Make sure to enable `config.checker.enabled = true`
to make this work.

Example of configuring <a href="https://github.com/nvim-lualine/lualine.nvim">lualine.nvim</a>

>lua
    require("lualine").setup({
      sections = {
        lualine_x = {
          {
            require("lazy.status").updates,
            cond = require("lazy.status").has_updates,
            color = { fg = "ff9e64" },
          },
        },
      },
    })
<


LOCKFILE `LAZY-LOCK.JSON`                *lazy.nvim-lockfile-`lazy-lock.json`*

After every **update**, the local lockfile is updated with the installed
revisions. It is recommended to have this file under version control.

If you use your Neovim config on multiple machines, using the lockfile, you can
ensure that the same version of every plugin is installed.

On the other machine, you can do `Lazy restore`, to update all your plugins to
the version from the lockfile

PERFORMANCE                                            *lazy.nvim-performance*

Great care has been taken to make the startup code (`lazy.core`) as efficient
as possible. During startup, all lua files used before `VimEnter` or
`BufReadPre` are byte-compiled and cached, similar to what impatient.nvim
<https://github.com/lewis6991/impatient.nvim> does.

My config for example loads in about `11ms` with `93` plugins. I do a lot of
lazy-loading though :)

**lazy.nvim** comes with an advanced profiler `:Lazy profile` to help you
improve performance. The profiling view shows you why and how long it took to
load your plugins.

STARTUP SEQUENCE                                  *lazy.nvim-startup-sequence*

**lazy.nvim** does **NOT** use Neovim packages and even disables plugin loading
completely (`vim.go.loadplugins = false`). It takes over the complete startup
sequence for more flexibility and better performance.

In practice this means that step 10 of |Neovim Initialization| is done by Lazy:


1. all plugins with `lazy=false` are loaded. This includes sourcing `/plugin` and `/ftdetect` files. (`/after` will not be sourced yet)
2. all files from `/plugin` and `/ftdetect` directories in you rtp are sourced (excluding `/after`)
3. all `/after/plugin` files are sourced (this inludes `/after` from plugins)
4. all the plugins’ `init()` functions are executed


Files from runtime directories are always sourced in alphabetical order.

STRUCTURING YOUR PLUGINS                  *lazy.nvim-structuring-your-plugins*

Some users may want to split their plugin specs in multiple files. Instead of
passing a spec table to `setup()`, you can use a lua module. The specs from the
**module** and any **sub-modules** will be merged together in the final spec,
so it is not needed to add `require` calls in your main plugin file to the
other files.

The benefits of using this approach:


- simple to **add** new plugin specs. Just create a new file in your plugins module.
- allows for **caching** of all your plugin specs. This becomes important if you have a lot of smaller plugin specs.
- spec changes will automatically be **reloaded** when they’re updated, so the `:Lazy` UI is always up to date


Example:


- `~/.config/nvim/init.lua`


>lua
    require("lazy").setup("plugins")
<



- `~/.config/nvim/lua/plugins.lua` or `~/.config/nvim/lua/plugins/init.lua` **_(this file is optional)_**


>lua
    return {
      "folke/neodev.nvim",
        "folke/which-key.nvim",
        { "folke/neoconf.nvim", cmd = "Neoconf" },
    }
<



- any lua file in `~/.config/nvim/lua/plugins/.lua` will be automatically merged in the main plugin spec


For a real-life example, you can check my personal dots:


- init.lua <https://github.com/folke/dot/blob/master/config/nvim/init.lua> where I require `config.lazy`
- config.lazy <https://github.com/folke/dot/blob/master/config/nvim/lua/config/lazy.lua> where I bootstrap and setup **lazy.nvim**
- config.plugins <https://github.com/folke/dot/blob/master/config/nvim/lua/config/plugins.lua> is my main plugin config module
- Any submodule of config.plugins (submodules) <https://github.com/folke/dot/tree/master/config/nvim/lua/config/plugins> will be automatically loaded as well.
